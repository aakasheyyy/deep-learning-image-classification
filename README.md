# deep-learning-image-classification
ðŸ§  Deep Learning Image Classification (MNIST)
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset.
This project demonstrates how deep learning can interpret visual patterns with high accuracy.

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
The model is trained to recognize digits from 0 to 9 and achieves nearly 99% validation accuracy.

The dataset contains:

60,000 training images

10,000 testing images

Each image is 28x28 pixels, grayscale.

ðŸ§© Features

âœ… Built using TensorFlow and Keras
âœ… Implements convolutional and pooling layers
âœ… Achieves high accuracy and low loss
âœ… Includes result visualizations and saved model file
âœ… Runs smoothly on Google Colab (Windows compatible)

ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

Open in Google Colab
Upload the file mnist_cnn_project.ipynb and open it in Colab.

Run all cells step by step
This will train and evaluate your CNN model.

Reload saved model (optional)

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model("mnist_cnn_model.h5")


Generate predictions
The notebook includes code to visualize results and save the image as sample_predictions.png.
